This is provides a plug-in for OpenVibe that enables it to transmit EEG signals
to ROS over a ZeroMQ publisher-subscriber socket. There is also a provided ROS
script written in python that receives the EEG data from ZeroMQ and publishes
it to a ROS topic. 

### ToDo:
- Post requirements.
- How to enable plug-in with OpenVibe.
- How to use plug-in.
- Using the ROS portion.
